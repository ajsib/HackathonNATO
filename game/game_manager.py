This includes securing major cities, critical infrastructure such as airports and seaports, and key transportation routes. We will deploy our forces to bolster border defenses and establish forward operating bases to enhance our situational awareness and response capabilities. This will allow us to quickly detect and respond to any hostile incursions by Team Red and Orange. Additionally, we will conduct joint exercises and training with our allies from Team Green to ensure seamless coordination and interoperability between our forces. This will enable us to effectively deter and repel any aggressive actions by the invading forces. Furthermore, we will engage in diplomatic efforts to garner international support and solidarity for our defensive efforts in the Baltic States. This includes highlighting the importance of upholding territorial integrity and sovereignty, and the need to prevent further escalation of the conflict."""
